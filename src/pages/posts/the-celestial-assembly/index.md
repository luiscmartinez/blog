# The Celestial Assembly

Only Two Great Saints appointed by The Creator,
The two Great Saints are at The University of The Creator, the place you need to come to study The Celestial Dharma.
There are two Great Saints that you may meet everyday,
Why don’t you quickly come?
See them in order to receive Celestial Blessing and Miracle.
Heaven is opening Celestial Assembly for 4 consecutive months starting October 3, 2019 to March 03, 2020.
Whoever comes on time will get a ticket for going back to heaven,
The ticket is Heaven’s Scroll.
Relative, family lineage, hurry and come, otherwise they can’t receive it.
This is the revelation of God's plan,
Receiving the Heaven’s Scroll is Celestial Blessing.
God’s plan starts moving.
The unique way for humankind is to correct their bad karma.
If a human being doesn’t have Heaven’s Scroll, Demon of Death will reap this human life.
This statement is informative, doesn’t threaten, wait and see.
Upcoming period is for Demon,
After March 3, 2020, group of Demons will use scanner to scan the human body to look for the Heaven’s Scroll, one doesn’t have it, even children, will be destroyed.
In the new High Cycle, a spiritual cultivator can link, directly contact, receive the teaching of the Great Saint, all old spiritual paths such as Buddhism of Sakya Muni, Catholic and Christian of Jesus Christ, Taoism of Lao-Tzu, Confucianism of Confucius, Hinduism,...are out of date, obsolete and will soon disappear, only one left: The Religion of The Creator is called THE WAY.
