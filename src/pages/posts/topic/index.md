##### In your life:

\*You worry about your future because you don’t know what happens to you, or your loved ones. You worry about the infinite unexpected possibilities in life.

\*You are fixated on choices you’ve made in the past and have trouble moving forward.

\*You want to do good in life but need the correct guidance to succeed.

\*You care about fulfilling your purpose on Earth

##### You carry what you cannot see

The human eye doesn’t see anything but what is visible when looking out into the universe. While outside our confined human level. There might be existences of other beings, such as giants or other beings with bodies structured completely different from ours to where they don’t require food or anything at all. The workings of a human body have been created very complicated.

\*Life after death is only a step further into a different perspective. A deceased person might still go to the market and buy food, essentially eating food from the invisible market, still going on with their daily activities in the other world that our human eyes cannot see.

\*A feeling holds its meaning with or without the human body.

### Law of Fairness

Principle: Each person carries their good and bad deeds; from there they are placed into a family to enjoy their good deeds or payback their bad actions together.

### Invisible government:

1. The machine of the invisible government: the universe is boundless, but the divinity is everywhere. The divinity administers the entire universe, ranks from high to low, is very tight and strict, manages the universe, galaxy, planet, continent, nation, mountains, rivers, cities, people, and all forms of living creatures. In brief, the machine of invisible government tightly runs under the granting favor of divinity to help the universe keep on moving and developing in order.

2. Power to give reward and punishment: All living forms from human beings to viruses, cells are granted the favor of divinity to live to the end of their life. When they act, develop out of their order, the divinity will punish them to warn them to return to order. Many different types of phenomena such as plagues, wars, earthquakes, sinkholes, tornados, typhoons, fires, volcano eruptions are administrated by the divinity.

3. Power to open your heart, and mind to develop correct thinking. Strange, odd phenomena cannot be explained by the language of physical scientists. Phenomena such as self-igniting fires, appearances of 100-year-old ghosts, an ancestor coming into each family members dreams to teach them to change their current way of living into a virtuous one. Are all phenomena directed by divinity from behind the scenes to show the power of the divinity, to lead human beings to understand the existence of the divinity, and to learn to cultivate reality. Unintentionally, people misunderstand or simply don’t know the turmoil of fame, money, power, miseries, and disasters.

\*A human being is a combination of all goods and bad deeds, we are also very small – weak – fragile piece of dust flying nowhere in the universe.

\*Every human being’s purpose is to be born to look for a position on Earth and in our mysterious universe. The ranks of the universe can be thought of as the hierarchy of degrees here on Earth that are A.S., B.S., M.S., Ph.D. degrees in Reality. Studying Reality leads to earning your A.S., B.S., M.S., Ph.D. in Reality
