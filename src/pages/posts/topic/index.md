##### In your life:

\*You worry about your future because you don’t know what happens to you, or your loved ones. You worry about the infinite unexpected possibilities in life.

\*You are fixated on choices you’ve made in the past and have trouble moving forward.

\*You want to do good in life but need the correct guidance to succeed.

\*You care about fulfilling your purpose on Earth

##### You carry what you cannot see

The human eye doesn’t see anything but what is visible when looking out into the universe. While outside our confined human level. There might be existences of other beings, such as giants or other beings with bodies structured completely different from ours to where they don’t require food or anything at all. The workings of a human body have been created very complicated.

\*Life after death is only a step further into a different perspective. A deceased person might still go to the market and buy food, essentially eating food from the invisible market, still going on with their daily activities in the other world that our human eyes cannot see.

\*A feeling holds its meaning with or without the human body.


### The divinity administers the universe

The universe is boundless, but the divinity is everywhere. The divinity administers the entire universe, ranks from high to low, manages the universe, galaxy, planet, continent, nation, people, all kinds of living creatures, even mountains, rivers, and pieces of land having their designated divinity, and grants favor to help the universe keep on moving and developing.



### Law of Fairness

All living creatures from human beings to viruses, cells are granted the favor of divinity to live to the end of their life. When they act, develop out of their order, the law of fairness warns them to return to order. Many different types of phenomena such as plagues, wars, earthquakes, sinkholes, tornados, typhoons, fires, volcano eruptions are put in effect by the law of fairness. 

### The divinity opens your heart and mind to develop your correct thinking

Strange, odd phenomena cannot be explained by the language of physical scientists. Phenomena such as self-igniting fires, appearances of 100-year-old ghosts, an ancestor coming into a family member to teach the family to change their current way of living into a virtuous one. Are all  phenomena directed by divinity from behind the scenes to lead human beings to know the existence of the divinity and to understand the reality. Unintentionally, people misunderstand or simply don’t know the turmoil of fame, money, power, miseries, and disasters.

### You are a human being
*A human being is a combination of all goods and bad deeds, we are also very small – weak – fragile piece of dust flying nowhere in the universe.

*Every human being’s purpose is to be born to look for a position on Earth and in our mysterious universe. The ranks of the universe can be thought of as the hierarchy of degrees here on Earth that are A.S., B.S., M.S., Ph.D. degrees in Reality. Studying Reality leads to earning your A.S., B.S., M.S., Ph.D. in Reality 
1. Earning position is a thousand times more value than any prestigious university = very good future
2. Studying Reality is timely, opportune and contemporary 
3. Applying Reality knowledge into your daily life so you’ll learn what’s your right direction, correct path

8. Adding reality understanding to solve human problems, and increase good deeds to reduce bad ones

10. In the next three thousand years, every person really needs the field, science, knowledge of REALITY to ensure a good future and high positions on the Earth and in the universe
