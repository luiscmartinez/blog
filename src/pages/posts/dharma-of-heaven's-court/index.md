# Dharma of Heaven's Court

The Dharma of Heaven is The Science of Metaphysics. It's transmission started from The Grand Master Triệu Phước who combines and systematize. The North Secret Branch and The South Secret Branch. After, he proves the existence of God for all Religions on Earth.

Before, the transmission of Secret Branch had only the inside school, local and the distinguishment about its origin. For example:
South Secret Branch,
North Secret Branch,
Secret Branch of India,
Secret Branch of Tibet,
Seven mountains spiritual power kung fu (thất sơn thần quyền)

At that time, secret branches were secretly transmitted only. Secret branches could not publicly transfer although they received many miracles in their branches.

Because these branches they were at a low level, still distinguished and considered themselves number one in the (secret branch) sector, did not open their mind to study, therefore they couldn't combine, summarize, largely teach principles of metaphysics scientifically and practically. Spirit guider teachers: when secret branch of Heaven's court appears: It is the public transmission period. Secret Branch is no more secret. With the permission of The Grand Master Triệu Phước, everyone (students) can receive a Heart Seal from Holy Spirit and study the Religion of God with The Master.

The secret branch of Heaven's Court or Dharma of Heaven's Court is a school teaching The Way, belonging to The Heaven's Court. The Grand Master has more than enough intelligence, blessing to publicly transmit Heart Seal of The Way to all levels of human beings easily.

Secret Dharma of Heaven's Court is a big tree with different schools being low, small branches only receiving some but not all lights. Dharma of Heaven's Court can encompass, cover all angles, aspects, from low to high, in all areas of metaphysics and is able to help a cultivator of The Way to become a teacher to teach real life, religion and mysticism in the future.

### Student Tình Duyên Spirit Guardian teaches :

Secret is The Secret Teaching of The 10 Directions Buddhas are divided into branches, schools in the world such as: secret branch of Tibet, China, Japan, Vietnam, Burma (miến điện), Thailand, Secret Branch of The North, Secret Branch of The South. And They couldn't publicly transmit to outside other than secretly publicly transmitting to a small number of teachers and students.

Today, in the low cycle, The Grand Master receives the whole mission of tranmission of The Dharma of Heaven's Court. In this world not called secret branch of Heaven's Court anymore. Because The Dharma of Heaven's Court is a super way for human kind to feel and verify the supernatural power of God. And only The Grand Master has "maximum virtue, blessing without boundary, unlimited blessing" to publicly transmits to the world, following the order of Heaven, in order to give a chance to human beings to experience an invisible real world behind { vague, unclear, misunderstanding } of human being's writings (books).

Students of The Grand Master and The Master have numerous lives of blessing, are accepted by Holy Spirit and taught by The Grand Master, The Master.

Not everyone has the chance. Therefore, the student of The Way respectfully esteems the dharma branch of The Grand Master and The Master, giving to, appreciates, respects deeply the blessing of The Grand Master and The Master.

The student studies with great intelligence, the great compassion, the great bravery from Heaven, going down to The Earth to rescue human being in the high cycle.

The high cycle is the period of the majority of Vietnamese people { know, have } the knowledge of The Way. {study , cultivate}

During this cycle, society will have less burden by people paying bad karma. Life of every person will become safer, peaceful, then Vietnam [or other society] will be in peace. But this period is still far away. So it needs the students of Secret Dharma multiply the unlimited light of The Grand Master, The Master to make clear (The Way) and flourish The Way.

-   Do students of The Way need to initiate a soul in invisible world? ⇒

    Yes.

    God's plan. God appoints the Grand Master and The Master build the {visible, tangible} results on Earth for {visible and invisible} world realm

    A soul in invisible world needs to be initiated : ⇒

    ⇒ to be prepared, on list for Holy Spirit prepare for them to be reincarnated on Earth.

    ⇒ to become a human being to study Metaphysics at the University of The Creator.

    Ancestor comes back to their home to teach their family members

Ancestor ⇒ with lots of **blessing**, and no or little bad karma = **deserve** to get permission from Holy Spirit to go back home

Ancestor ⇒ with lost of **bad karma** + little blessing = **does NOT deserve** to get permission from Holy Spirit to go back home ⇒ Holy Spirit ⇒ **WILL APPEAR AS ANCESTOR** instead of real ancestor

Revelation = scared images from Sprit Guardian ⇒ do not bleieve ⇒ but just get an **IDEA**

**Do not study deeply the Revelation**

### Sacred image = illusion ⇒ sometimes true, sometimes false

### {Event, Phenomenon} = Real case ⬅️ {study, Reasoning of The Way, The Truth}

### Why does an initiated cultivator of The Way still { run amok, become illusive, become crazy } ?

-   A cultivator of The Way recites The 5 essential Dharanis === Heart of Buddha

    **while cultivator is initiated = having divine sign = having a spirit guardian who has responsibility with The Heaven's Court about their student**

    -   still runs amok ?

    *   spirit guardian cannot complete **{ his duty, his work, his teaching } with** his student that 10 directions buddha gave mission to the spirit guardian

    **Satan, Demon { have as equal power as The Creator, appears as { The Creator, Buddha, Holy Spirit } }**

    **How can student of The Way distinguished a spirit guardian with Satan, Demon?**
